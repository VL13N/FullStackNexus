# TAAPI Pro Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
TAAPI Pro API key is being rejected with HTTP 401 "You are not authenticated to query this endpoint" across all endpoints and authentication methods.

## Diagnostic Results
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 0/14 (0%)
- **Tested Methods**: Query string, Bearer token, API key header
- **Tested Endpoints**: RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA, Price, Volume
- **Tested Symbols**: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, ADA/USDT
- **Error Pattern**: Consistent 401 authentication failure

## Your API Key Status
- **Format**: JWT token (correct format detected)
- **First 20 chars**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`
- **Server Response**: "You are not authenticated to query this endpoint! Please check your secret key, otherwise please get in touch with us."

## Required Actions
1. **Verify TAAPI Pro Account Status**
   - Log into your TAAPI dashboard at https://taapi.io/
   - Check if your subscription is active and payments are current
   - Verify your plan includes technical indicator access

2. **Check API Key Permissions**
   - Confirm the API key hasn't expired or been regenerated
   - Verify the key has permissions for RSI, MACD, EMA indicators
   - Check if there are IP restrictions or usage quotas exceeded

3. **Contact TAAPI Support**
   - Email support@taapi.io with your account details
   - Reference the consistent 401 authentication errors
   - Request verification of API key permissions and account status
