1. TAAPI Pro Integration Issues
1.1. Common Causes of “Need a Pro Key” or “Invalid Key” Errors

    Key Mismatch / Typos / Not Restarted

        TAAPI’s error “You are not authenticated to query this endpoint” (HTTP 401) almost always means the secret query parameter is wrong or missing.

        If you recently updated TAAPI_API_KEY in Replit’s Secrets, you must restart the Replit container so the new env-var propagates. Otherwise your code may still be reading an old (free-tier) key.

    Using the Wrong Query Parameter

        TAAPI Pro expects ?secret=<your_key>&exchange=binance&symbol=SOL/USDT&interval=1h.

        If you inadvertently used ?key= instead of ?secret=, or omitted exchange/symbol, the request will default to free-tier behavior (or fail).

    IP Whitelisting / Permissions

        Some TAAPI plans can lock keys to specific IPs or domains. If your Replit instance’s outgoing IP isn’t whitelisted, you’ll see authentication errors. Check “My Account → Usage → IP Access” in TAAPI’s dashboard.

    Exceeded Plan Quota

        Even paid plans have daily/monthly quotas. If you’re polling every minute across multiple indicators, you may be hitting your limit, causing TAAPI to treat you like a free-tier user.

        Example: 5 indicators × 1 token × 60 calls/hour = 300 calls/hour → 7,200 calls/day. If your Pro plan only allows 5,000 calls/day, you’ll start getting “need pro key” errors again.

    Not Using the Bulk Endpoint

        Fetching each indicator separately consumes more credits. TAAPI Pro’s /bulk endpoint allows 3–5 indicators in one request, counting as 3–5 credits instead of N separate API calls. Using bulk can prevent quota exhaustion.

1.2. Steps to Diagnose & Fix

    Verify the Exact Key in Replit’s Secrets

        Open your Replit project’s “Secrets” panel. Copy/paste your TAAPI Pro key verbatim from https://taapi.io/account/ → “Active Keys.”

        Restart the Replit container (via kill 1 or the “Stop”/“Run” buttons).

    Test Directly with curl

curl -i "https://api.taapi.io/rsi?secret=${TAAPI_API_KEY}&exchange=binance&symbol=SOL/USDT&interval=1h"

    A 200 OK with { "value": <number> } means your key is valid and Pro-enabled. If you see HTTP 401 or “Rate limit exceeded,” your key is still wrong or over-quota.

Switch to Bulk Endpoint (if you need multiple indicators)

    Bulk reduces per-indicator calls. Even if you’ve “got a Pro key,” separate calls for RSI, MACD, EMA etc. can still exhaust your quota faster than expected.

    Use:

    POST https://api.taapi.io/bulk  
    {
      "secret": "<TAAPI_API_KEY>",
      "construct": { "exchange":"binance", "symbol":"SOL/USDT", "interval":"1h" },
      "indicators": [{ "name":"rsi" }, { "name":"macd" }, { "name":"ema", "params":{ "period":200 } }]
    }

    This counts as 3 credits (one per indicator) instead of 3 separate requests.

Throttle & Cache

    Cache each bulk response for 15–30 minutes in memory or a simple LRU cache.

    If you truly need hourly updates, you can fetch once per hour instead of every minute.

Check IP Whitelisting

    In the TAAPI dashboard, go to “Usage → IP Access.” Ensure that your Replit container’s outbound IP (Replit’s dynamic IP) is allowed. If you’re unsure what that IP is, temporarily disable IP restrictions in TAAPI or set it to 0.0.0.0/0 as a test.
